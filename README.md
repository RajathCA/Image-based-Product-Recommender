# Image-based-Product-Recommender
CS300 - Mini Project. A mobile application developed using flutter that takes an image of a product and produces a text-based classification which is then searched on Amazon. A mechanism that collects feedback and stores it, so it can then be used to refine the model at a later stage, is also implemented.
